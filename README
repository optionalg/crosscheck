Crosscheck

Background

I recently had to correlate two text files, each with a large 
amount of entries (>250k lines) in them. Finding similarities
using grep -f [file1] [file2] was a total waste of time, so 
I just decided to use Python's generators to accomplish what
I want.

Usage

bin/crosscheck.py [reference file] [file to grep]

Requirements

Python > 2.3
